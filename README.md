## What is it?

There has been a requirement to refresh the existing public art catalogue listings on the B&NES website as these pages hadn't been looked at for a little while and were looking a little tired.

The public art around B&NES is something that is worth highlighting, and this is an excellent collection of images and associated data.

The data has been made available to the Bath: Hacked datastore and this project will use the data directly from there, as well as welcome enhancements and features from the community.
## Technologies used

TODO: List the high level technologies.

A list of technologies used in the project.  Associated descriptions can also be used to cover any design decisions and why those technologies were used.

## Build

## Deployment

On building the project will be hosted on a B&NES Council web server, and as it is a plain HTML/JavaScript/CSS project should not need complex installation.

## Usage

1. Browse photos.

2. Item details.  

3. Search/Filter/Order.
